#Below test cases have been covered:-

1. Binary tree given in assignment doc. Distance b/w node 7 and 1.
	O/p :- 2
	
2. Binary tree given in assignment doc. Distance b/w node 9 and 4.
	O/p :- 5
	
3. Full binary tree with 15 nodes and each node having 2 children. Nodes are inserted in order:-(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15). Distance b/w 8 and 15(i.e extreme left child and extreme right child)
	O/p:- 6
	
4. Left skewed binary tree with 10 nodes. Nodes are inserted in order:- (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10). (No two nodes will be on same level)
	O/p:-Nodes are not on same level
	
5. Right skewed binary tree with 10 nodes. Nodes are inserted in order:- (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10). (No two nodes will be on same level)
	O/p:-Nodes are not on same level
	
6. Binary tree given in assignment doc. Distance b/w node 10(which doesn't exist) and 4.
	O/p:- Either of the node doesn't exist in binary tree
	
7. Binary tree with only one node i.e root node. Distance b/w node 2 and 3. (Node doesn't exist)
	O/p:-Either of the node doesn't exist in binary tree
	
8. Binary tree given in assignment doc. Distance b/w same node i.e 7 and 7.
	O/p:- Both the given nodes are same
