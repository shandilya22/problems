Write a program that accepts student records in the format “roll number”,”score” and prints 
them in decreasing order of scores. If there are multiple records for the same student, 
choose a single record with the highest score. The output should consist of the combination of roll number 
and score in decreasing order of score.  Sample input: [ “1001,40”, “1002,50”, “1003,60”, “1002,80”, “1005,35”, “1005,55”, “1007,68”, “1009,99”, “1009,10”, “1004,89” ]  Expected output: [ “1009,99”, “1004,89”, “1002,80”, “1007,68”, “1003,60”, “1005,55”, “1001,40” ]
